                        Before you pitch off your sleepmat and
                        jump in, there's ll few things we need to
                        tell you. First of all, the name. Cyberpunk
                        comes from two words. Cyber-from
                        the term cybernetic, or a fusion offlesh
                        and machine technology. Punk-from
                        an early l 980's rock music style that
                        epitomized violence, rebellion and
                        social action in a nihillistic way. The
                        term was popularized in the Pre-Colla pse days by a group of writers who
                        specialized in writing science fiction
                        with this kind oftechno-melange. Their
                        works featured II streamlined blend of
                        rock, pop, sex, drugs and the highest,
                        hippest technology-usually grafted
                        onto your body somewhere. The
                        archetypical cyberpunk heroes of the
                        80's ranged from technobarbarians
                        roaming a Postholocaust world, to
                        cyberchipped jet setters with designer
                        bodies.

                        Of course, from our enlightened viewpoint here in 2020, this all looks pretty
                        dated. After all, you probably accessed
                        this article from your personal database
